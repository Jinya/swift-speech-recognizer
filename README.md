# SwiftSpeechCombine

A very straightforward Combine wrapper around Speech Recognition part of SFSpeechRecognizer to allow you using this with ease.

## Usage

You can instantiate/inject `SpeechRecognitionEngine` object, it has this behavior

* `func requestAuthorization()`: call this method when you want to ask user if you can use Speech Recognition. Please, follow Apple Human Guidelines recommendations: [Asking Permission to Use Speech Recognition](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech/asking_permission_to_use_speech_recognition)
  * subscribe to `authorizationStatusPublisher` to know when and what's the user decision (see below)
* `func startRecording() throws`: call this method when you want to start the speech recognition, all the complexity with `AVAudioEngine` is hidden behind this function.
  * subscribe to `recognizedUtterancePublisher` or `newUtterancePublisher` depending on your needs. See below the difference
* `func stopRecording()`: call this method when you want the speech recognition to stop

* `var authorizationStatusPublisher`: subscribe to this to know what's the current authorization status of the speech recognition (this authorization include the microphone usage)
* `var recognizedUtterancePublisher`: subscribe to this to know when a `String` is recognized
* `var isRecognitionAvailablePublisher`: subscribe to this to know when the recognition status changed. It could be:
  * `notStarted`: no recognition has started yet for the session
  * `recording`: the recognition is processing
  * `stopping`: a stop recognition has just been triggered
  * `stopped`: the recognition is stopped, and is ready to start the next recognition
* `var isRecognitionAvailablePublisher`: subscribe to this to know when the Speech Recognition is available on the device (like if the internet connection allows the Speech Recognition to be processed)
* `var newUtterancePublisher`: subscribe to this if you're only interested in "new" actual utterance. It's actually a shortcut of `recognizedUtterancePublisher` while it removes duplicates and only take an actual String (so it's never `nil`)

Example

```swift
import Combine
import Speech
import SwiftSpeechCombine

let engine: SpeechRecognitionEngine = SpeechRecognitionSpeechEngine()
var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

// Only start to record if you're authorized to do so!
func speechRecognitionStatusChanged(authorizationStatus: SFSpeechRecognizerAuthorizationStatus) {
    guard authorizationStatus == .authorized
    else { return }

    do {
        try engine.startRecording()

        engine.newUtterancePublisher
            .sink { newUtterance in
                // Do whatever you want with the recognized utterance...
                print(newUtterance)
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)

        engine.recognitionStatusPublisher
            .sink { status in
                // Very useful to notify the user of the current status
                setTheButtonState(status: status)
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    } catch {
        print(error)
        engine.stopRecording()
    }
}

func setTheButtonState(status: SpeechRecognitionStatus) {
    switch status {
    case .notStarted: print("The button is ready to be tapped")
    case .recording: print("The button is showing a progress spinner")
    case .stopping: print("The button is disabled")
    case .stopped: print("The button is ready to be tapped for a new recognition")
    }
}

engine.requestAuthorization()

engine.authorizationStatusPublisher
    .compactMap { $0 }
    .sink { authorizationStatus in
        speechRecognitionStatusChanged(authorizationStatus: authorizationStatus)
    }
    .store(in: &cancellables)
```

## Installation

### Xcode

You can add SwiftSpeechCombine to an Xcode project by adding it as a package dependency.

1. From the **File** menu, select **Swift Packages â€º Add Package Dependency...**
2. Enter "https://github.com/renaudjenny/SwiftSpeechCombine" into the package repository URL test field

### As package dependency

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/renaudjenny/SwiftSpeechCombine", from: "0.0.1"),
        ...
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "<Your project name>",
            dependencies: ["SwiftSpeechCombine"]),
        ...
    ]
)
```
